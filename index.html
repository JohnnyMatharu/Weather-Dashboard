Your Task 3rd party api call for weather making requests with specific parameters to a URL.  

Use the OpenWeather API (Links to an external site.) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that provides basic setup and usage instructions. You will use localStorage to store any persistent data.

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
